				<div class="newProjectsTitle">Confidential new Google hardware product, launching 20XX</div>
				<div class="newProjectsBody">
					Part of a small but mighty team of 4 that prototyped, validated, & moved the product pitch up the chain to Sundar Pichai, leading to a fully staffed product. Through a multi-year process I lead design direction for key areas including input direction, cross-device UX, and a high priority experience
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="panelSpacer"></div>
			<div class="panel2">
				<div class="newProjectsTitle">A new hip hop media brand, grown to 30K subs & 4M views in 2 years</div>
				<div class="newProjectsBody">
					Helped my brother start a brand that has collaborated with rappers including Juice WRLD, Lil Keed, Famous Dex, and more. I’ve set design direction, created motion graphic, merch, live events, filmed content & did whatever it took to turn a dream into reality
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="twoPanel">
			<div class="panel1">
				<div class="newProjectsTitle">An audio-based social app for Area 120, launched in private beta</div>
				<div class="newProjectsBody">
					Worked within a product incubator with a PM and engineer to build out the first version of the app to get the project off the ground. The team is now fully staffed and working through a private beta
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="panelSpacer"></div>
			<div class="panel2">
				<div class="newProjectsTitle">AR camera mode for Google Maps, launched at Google I/O</div>
				<div class="newProjectsBody">
					Research and prototyping to generate design insights for one of the first mobile AR projects at Google. My work laid out a design direction and helped justify staffing a team for a camera mode in Google Maps

		<div class="twoPanel">
			<div class="panel1">
				<div class="newProjectsTitle">Launching a lightweight creation tool for education in VR</div>

			<div class="panel1">
				<div class="newProjectsTitle">Product explorations that didn’t achieve product-market-fit</div>
				<div class="newProjectsBody">
					Launching products at big companies is not at easy task. In my time at Google I’ve run tons of experiments through prototyping — and make it a point to create compelling documentation of my learnings to help move the company forward in areas of emerging technology, even when PMF may not be there
