		Through our workshop with the coordinators and sales team, we uncovered issues relating to their relationship with managers which we wanted to explore further from managers’ perspectives. We knew telling managers direct complaints was not an effective method to enact change, and so we used conversation started that we made based on the issues we uncovered with coordinators and sales. One key idea going into this workshop was not to place blame, but to genuinely uncover a manager’s motivations and perspective on the management decisions they made throughout the year.

	<span class="caseWritingSpan">
		We were really surprised to hear managers’ perspectives on events that had taken place throughout the year. We uncovered both the personal and organizational reasons that some of the managers felt were hindering their ability to lead their team. This started a dialogue in which individual managers were able to share similar experiences and help each other feel more comfortable. We then did the staff your team exercise to come up with solutions on how the managers felt the teams could be better structured based on the experiences they’d had that year.
