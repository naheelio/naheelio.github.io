		After uncovering a series of issues and perspectives with different groups of stakeholders in the organization, we thought of ways we could implement solutions that came out of these workshops.
		<br>
		<br>
		Two key high-level takeaways from these workshops were:
		<br>
		<br>
		1 - The one-year term is too short to be able to both fully understand the organization and effectively enact solutions.
		<br>
		<br>
		2 - The workshops themselves were an effective way of gathering solutions from the ground and getting stakeholders feeling motivated and part of the larger group.
		<br>
		<br>
		We decided to work with the current program managers to create a toolkit that the organization could use for years to come. This could empower new program managers with the tools they need to understand the organization much faster and be able to spend more of their term implementing new ideas to help the organization mature.

		We took the program managers through a 2 hour co-creation session in they created a workshop schedule for the following year to address key areas they wanted to address.
		<br>
		<br>
		The session itself served as a way for the program managers to learn about the findings from the previous workshops, and understand the different perspectives in the organization and its partnership. This helped them see the value in co-creation and helped to start its integration into Soap for Hopeâ€™s organizational processes.
