		Once you’ve gotten a set of issues expressed by a group, a spider diagram can be a quick and dirty way of creating actionable solutions to address those issues. Solutions that come out of this activity will have a greater chance of implementation, since the people who participated in the activity will already feel a sense of ownership of the ideas.

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">1</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Figure out the group of people you want participating in the activity. You should include the people who would be affected by the proposed solutions, as well as some outside, but related perspectives that could help the group see the problem from another angle.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepTip">
	Hint: This activity should be done right after an issue generation activity, so that the topics are fresh in the minds of the participants.
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">2</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Put 4 high level issues on the corners of a poster paper. Draw a line from each corner towards the middle of the poster. Refer to the downloadable materials for a visual of this.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">3</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Give the participants time on their own to come up with solutions for each issue, and have them write them on a sticky note and post them on the line connected to the related issue.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepTip">
	Hint: We’ve found that the simple form of the spider diagram actually is much more effective than just asking people to go in a circle and brainstorm ideas, or even just having them post ideas on a blank wall.
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">4</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">GOnce all the ideas are up on the poster, go around discussing each idea, and ask people to offer their opinions on a solution, and to build on top of them. Try to understand the essence of the solutions they are proposing, so that when you eventually implement one of them, you are doing so in a way that gets to the core of the change your participants wish to see.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">5</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Group some of the similar ideas together, and have the participants vote to see which solutions have the most support. Have another discussion about this before you take this away and figure out ways you can implement some of these changes.</div>
