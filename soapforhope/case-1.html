		In our initial workshop visits, we noticed a disconnect between the coordinators and their counterparts on the sales team. Not only was there miscommunication between the two parties, but it had gotten to the point where the teams no longer cared about the organization’s process beyond their own part. Neither team could empathize with the roles of the other and we wanted to tackle this by bringing them together to understand each other’s roles, help each other brainstorm solutions, and make some new friends along the way.

		Through the use of the collage method, we started to get the two teams mixing up and sharing their experience in a fun and light way. The easy-to-access form of this method helped us to transition into more serious challenges members had faced, such as a sales member who talked about their motivational struggle after the team’s lead had quit. This exercise started to help the teams see each others’ perspectives and bond quickly, even though most of them hadn’t met each other throughout the entire year. The collages brought out some high-level issues and we then used the spider diagram exercise to brainstorm and discuss solutions across the two teams.
