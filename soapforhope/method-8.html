		Often new ideas aren’t introduced into an organization out of fear that they might have an unintended negative impact. Introducing the concept of two-week long implementations of ideas helps free up the burden from team members of feeling like they will be criticized for an unsuccessful idea, and instead shifts over towards a culture of experimentation and learning from your failures. This is especially a good activity to start early on in the term, when the group has a more unfiltered ideation process.

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">1</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Take a proposed solution from one of the previous activities, and get together a group of people to create an implementation plan. We suggest you include some of the people who were vocal about the creation of the idea, as well as other supporting roles who will be affected by the idea.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">2</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Every idea is unique, so your needs may vary, but we have provided a worksheet you can fill out together to come up with a plan for the implementation of this two-week pilot.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepTip">
	Hint: If you craft your own worksheet for the idea, make sure you at least include sections for a one sentence pitch, implementation roles, and a metric for success.
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">3</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Send out an e-mail to the whole team pitching the idea, and tell them you will share the results after a couple weeks.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">4</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">After two weeks of piloting the idea, come back as a group to measure the success of the idea, and figure out if you want to implement this idea further into the processes of the group for the rest of the year.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">5</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Document your learning both for future teams, as well as for a recap e-mail that you send to your team. Include an invitation to discuss the experiment with members of the team who weren’t part of the pilot.</div>
