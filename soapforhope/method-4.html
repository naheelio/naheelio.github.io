		Sometimes bringing the right mix of people into a room can lead to the most useful insights. This can help you understand how specific groups of people in Soap for Hope view a topic. For example, are you trying to understand what’s happening on the ground at one of the production locations? Bring together some of the key players from one of those workshops. Are you trying to understand how to better engage some people who are underperforming? Bring them together to understand their challenges in the term.

		<!-- Steps Content Below -->

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">1</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Choose a group of people and a high-level goal from the group interview. This step is crucial, because you want to choose a group of people who will feel comfortable being open and honest around each other.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">2</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Treat the activity as more of a conversation, but have structured questions to fall back on to keep things on track. When someone says something, probe them by asking why they feel that way -- this is will help you uncover their raw feelings on a particular topic.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepTip">Hint: Make sure that you look people eye-to-eye, and are sitting on the same level as them, rather than standing up in front of the group. This will make them feel more comfortable and hint to them that you are really paying attention to them.
	</div>

	<div class="methodContentStepContainer">
			<div class="methodContentStepNumber">3</div>
			<div class="methodContentStepInfo">Have someone running the activity with you and get them to take notes. It’s important that the person asking questions is not also taking notes, as this will break the feeling of an open conversation among participants.</div>
