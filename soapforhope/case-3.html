		After visiting a very successful first workshop at HFFS, we were curious to see how the relationship between Soap for Hope and HFFS would pan out over time. We came to a workshop 8 weeks later to get the perspectives of both the workers, as well as the executive team that ran the house. Running a co-creation workshop at HFFS is a lot tougher, particularly with the soap-making participants. It was important to go in with a back-up plan if they were not receptive to an activity, and to be as open as possible about the shared goal of improving their experience with Soap for Hope.

	<span class="caseWritingSpan">
		The mapping out feelings activity did not go according to plan, as all the people who were making soap that day were completely new to the workshops and even fairly new to the house. This uncovered something interesting however, which was the retention rate in workshop participants. This taught us that coordinators need to be trained to be able to run every soap-making workshop as if it was the very first workshop for the participant, which it very often is. The role playing activity was used to give the members of the house the chance to express how they would run the workshops, and uncovered some ideas around consistency in coordinators, as well as perspectives on which tools could be changed to make the process easier for them. These insights are hard, if not impossible, to get without involving the people in the house. We also did a group interview with the executive team of the house to understand their experience with Soap for Hope, learning that they liked the low maintenance of the workshops and wanted to hear more from Soap for Hope about their experience if they needed any assistance.
